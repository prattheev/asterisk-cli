 *  This is not a life-saving device and must not be used to build one,
 *  or a medical device, oh, and also, this is not something you'd want
 *  to put in a nuclear power plant, or anything else for that matter.
 *  In fact, you'd be wise to print a copy, destroy all other copies,
 *  including electronic copies, burn the printout, dissolve the ashes
 *  in acid, and bury the waste into a hole in the desert.
